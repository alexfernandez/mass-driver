# mass-driver

This page is dedicated to the study of a
[mass driver](mass driver):
space travel made easy!

## Concept

A vehicle is launched from the top of a high mountain,
accelerated to scape velocity
(with some margin for speed lost to drag).
It is driven up there using a linear motor,
essentially a large coilgun in a tunnel
where a near vaccuum is kept.

## Simulation

Open the [drag simulator](./drag.html) in a browser.
It is a very crude simulation of drag for a mass driver.
There are several adjustable parameters.

## References

Forces are computed using the
[drag equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_equation).
Air density at any height is computed very crudely using the
[ideal gas law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_air).
Temperature is
[linearly interpolated](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/bookchap2.html).

Drag coefficient supposes the vehicle is a
[waverider](http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/waverider/main.shtml).

## Conclusion

A mass driver will surely be the way of space exploration
in the near future.
